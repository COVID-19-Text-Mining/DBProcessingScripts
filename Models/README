#TfidfVectorizer fitted to all abstracts in 'ectries' collection. Preprocessing is done with the matscholar function. To use it, you should add the following:

from matscholar_core.nlp import relevance
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import dill as pickle

with open('Models/tfidf.p', "rb") as f:
	tfidf = dill.load(f)

relClass = relevance.RelevanceClassifier()
processed = relClass._preprocess(YOUR_DOCUMENT)

X = tfidf.transform([processed])
